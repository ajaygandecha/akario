**Akario** is a web app of *Akari*. Akari, also known as *Light Up*, is a logic puzzle game originally created by [Nikoli (ニコリ)](https://www.nikoli.co.jp/en/), a Japanese publisher that specializes in creating games and logic puzzles. Nikoli became prominent around the world due to the popularity of another logic puzzle game they created, *Sudoku*.
