# Akario

**Akario** is a web app of *Akari*. Akari, also known as *Light Up*, is a logic puzzle game originally created by [Nikoli (ニコリ)](https://www.nikoli.co.jp/en/), a Japanese publisher that specializes in creating games and logic puzzles. Nikoli became prominent around the world due to the popularity of another logic puzzle game they created, *Sudoku*.

Akario is hosted using Vercel and is **available now** to play at [https://akario-ajaygandecha.vercel.app](https://akario-ajaygandecha.vercel.app)!

## Technologies and Approach

Part of my goal for this project was to employ the full-stack development tools and technologies heavily used as standard in industry. I wanted the project to be typesafe, streamlined, and fully integrated together. With this goal in mind, I employed the following technologies into my project:

![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/-TypeScript-05122A?style=flat&logo=typescript)

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to traditional JavaScript. While TypeScript seemed more tedious to work with at first, using it instead of JavaScript really helped to reduce errors in the long run due to more strict typing rules. Therefore, I opted to use TypeScript for this project. In addition, TypeScript is the preferred language for the framework below. 

![NextJS](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Next.js-05122A?style=flat&logo=next.js)

Next.js is a frontend framework built on the React library that enables rich features and optimizations to the application, such as hybrid static & server rendering, which greatly increases speeds without sacrificing user experience.

Next.js has become an [industry standard](https://nextjs.org/showcase), with companies such as Twitch, Hulu, Target, Notion, Nike, and more utiziling it. I wanted to gain more experience developing with Next.js, so I decided to use it in this project.



## Current Status

Akario is still actively developed! New puzzles, modes, and features will be released very soon.
